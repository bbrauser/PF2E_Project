# PF2E_Project
A personal project to help players of my Pathfinder 2nd Edition games

The ultimate aim of this project is to have someone enter a character backstory, character concept, or something similar, resulting in a couple character choices (ancestry, heritages, feats, etc.) using natural language processing.

A secondary aim of this project is to analyze the different choices offered in official, published materials from Paizo for Pathfinder 2nd Edition to see what would be optimal character choices.
